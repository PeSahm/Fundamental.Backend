CHAT CONVERSATION WITH USER:
- it can become useful to know what are the considerations, change the narations to from AI to User conversation into what was considered:

Example:
```
System: It's broken because SomeToolName was doing E,F,G
User: Can we try this tool?
System: I tried and it failed because of X, Y, Z

User: Let's take this approach A,B,C because we will do X,Y,Z later
System: I tried and it worked because of X,Y,Z
```

becomes:
```
Inspections in <Logs> revealed that SomeToolName was doing E,F,G, the logs is in appendeix
To Adddress, It was considered X,Y,Z

STEP BY STEP

1. do a `git reset && git diff` and create list of diff
2. Review all changes and make sure there is no sensitive data, like secrets, passwords, private keys, personal data, credentials, tokens, or any other sensitive information.
2. group them into change list that indicate it was done 1 item only
3. review all change list and re-order them to ensure they are cherry-pick friendly and can be reverted easily
4. create commit list to be commited
5. for each commit check message/log history and explain why this was done and what was the reason
6. present each commit to user with message and change-list (files and what overview) to review

## Important Notes

- Make sure all current checkout branches have latest remote commit, it's possible the current repo is missing a work on current branch.
- If user asked to move git submodule path or files or rename, always use `git mv` first.
- When you see `.gitmodules` double check all modified content/commits.
